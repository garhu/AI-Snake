# AI Snake

AI Snake is an AI agent that uses a Q-learning algorithm to play the game. To test the decision making process of the agent, new elements to the game were introduced: walls and bad fruit. Walls appear after each fruit is picked up and collision with the walls result in a game over condition. Bad fruit appear similarly to normal fruit, but they decrease the score. These new obstacles allowed for analysis of the agent's decision-making capabilities in a dynamically growing maze.
